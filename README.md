## Risk Management
A risk is an event that is uncertain that will cause an effect on an objective.
* Qualitative risk assessment where risks are split into impact and likelyhood.
* **Risk Category:** What the risk impacts **TODO** Decide which categories are more important
* **Likelyhood:** How likely the risk is to occure
* **Impact:**
A response to the risk is then formulated. The response will either remove the risk completely or reduce its serverity.
